    <h1>The Allison Foundation</h1>
    <p>
      The Foundation originally started because we noticed our community lacking in areas we felt needed more attention. The program was created to help build better opportunities to those who are less fortunate. Along with many other resources that will gradually be acquired such as grants and other services. Here at the Allison Foundation we want you to know we care about our community and what our surrounding peers think about our wonderful program. Please feel free to ask any questions and/or concerns and we would gladly be willing to give a response. Thank you and have blessed day.

Growing up here in the basin really made Elton want to give back to the beautiful community that helped him become the man he was.<br> He worked to enhance many relations within our community, there were many ways he made it possible to donate funds as well as time and knowledge to help push our community forward. <br>Elton was an avid outdoorsman, who enjoyed hunting and hiking, he also ran yearly backpacking trips with our youth. <br>Elton ran a girls basketball team full of his own relations, nieces, and even his own daughter at one point in time.<br> We will forever be grateful for the efforts of Allison Elton Blackhair, and in his name we honor by providing our community with The Allison Foundation.
